## About Archive Nodes

Archive nodes store not only the most recent state but all the historical states of the blockchain, unlike full nodes which store the state up to the last 128 blocks. Archive nodes are essential for applications that require access to the full history of the blockchain for analysis, ensuring data integrity and supporting complex queries.

### What is an Archive Node Client?

An archive node client is a local implementation of a blockchain node that maintains a complete history of blockchain states.

### Popular Archive Node Clients

The most widely used and trusted archive node clients include:

- **Go Ethereum (Geth)**
- **Erigon**
- **Nethermind**
- **Besu**

These clients are renowned for their stability, extensive documentation, and active community support.
